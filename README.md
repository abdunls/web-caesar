Welcome to my text encryptor!

The purpose of this is to encrypt text. A user can input text and a number which the characters will rotate by. For example, if `Hello, World!` is inputted, `Jgnnq, yqtnf!` should be returned when **Submit Query** button is pressed. 

To run this, first make sure you have flask installed. Run `pip install flask`. Then you can run it locally. Follow the link in your Terminal to see it come to life. Mine is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
